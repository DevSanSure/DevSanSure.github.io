                    <p>"If you can't make it good, at least make it look good" ~Bill Gates, It was this simple yet meaningful quote that
                        inspired me to pave a path of success in my endeavors. Passionate about everything I do, and I challenge myself
                        to do better today than I did yesterday, which allows me to always keep learning, brainstorming innovative &
                        creative ways of solving everyday tasks.</p>

                                        <p><span><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i></span> I personally have had the opportunity to work alongside Mr. Suresh over the past two
                                            years. I can honestly say that he is a dependable person who works endlessly to complete
                                            everything he sets his mind to accomplish.
                                            Mr. Suresh is currently an active member of the St. Kitts and Nevis Robotics Association.
                                            He currently holds the position Innovation and Technology Coordinator; he has proven to be
                                            effective in this role. As the Innovation and Technology Coordinator, Mr. Suresh works with the
                                            I.T. Director who is responsible for overseeing the associations website, assisting with
                                            innovative ideas to put the association's name apart of the conversation as it pertains to
                                            technology.
                                            Mr. Suresh has also held other posts such as Programme Director. In this role he was
                                            responsible for ensuring and executing the association's mandates, projects, and other activities.
                                            These would include Robotics After School Program, Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts
                                            and Mathematics (STEAM) Education sessions with members of SKNRA, and fundraisers. He
                                            played an important role in ensuring the success of our most recent event, the St. Kitts and Nevis
                                            Marine Drone Challenge 2021. We are truly grateful to have Mr. Suresh on our team.
                                            Mr. Suresh is currently a mentor for the St. Kitts and Nevis Robotics Team in the First
                                            Global Robotics Challenge 2021. In 2020, he was the team captain and successfully lead the
                                            team to first (1st) in the Caribbean & OECS and thirtieth (30th) in the world. That is the best our
                                            team and country has placed in the challenge for the four (4) years we've been competing. He
                                            also assisted the team that travelled in 2019, where he was the on-ground support. He has also
                                            assisted as a host\content creator on SKNRA's radio show 'Let's Talk I.T.'. As the Innovation
                                            and Technology Coordinator, his role extends to Technical Support on the show. However, he
                                            joins in on the show as a host, or guest when he is needed. Mr. Suresh shows that he is a team
                                            player in every way.
                                            Mr. Suresh is dependable not only on a professional level, but also in relations to personal
                                            matters. He has proven to be someone full of determination, and persistence. I'm sure he will fit
                                            in well no matter where he is placed, he is someone to have on your team. He works hard, always
                                            puts his best foot forward and never ceases to amaze one with his capabilities. <span><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i></span> ~ Mr. Shaqueed Benjamin - Executive Director</p>

Sanjiv Suresh for the past two years as student in the Information Technology Program at the Clarence Fitzroy Bryant College's Technical and Vocational Education and Management Studies Division. During my tenure as Dean, I interact with students across various departments within the institution. I found Mr. Suresh to be very friendly with peers and always courteous to his Lecturers. I have been consistently impressed with the positive attitude that Mr.
                                            Suresh displays towards his studies, research projects and fellow students of CBC as a whole.
                                            Mr. Suresh's performance during his period of study was above average with a GPA above 3.61.
                                            Additionally, he participated in CFBC-TVEMS highly publicized end of year Capstone Competency Project Presentation 
                                            by the Information Technology students. Mr. Suresh was recognized for academic performance by making the Dean's Lists for the 
                                            4 semesters he attended CFBC. I am writing to you in support of Mr. Sanjiv Suresh and his desire to matriculate to your academic 
                                            programme. I support his decision and strong desire to take his dedication and skill to the next level. Mr. Suresh is hard working 
                                            and has the drive to succeed at the highest level in any field of study. With his combination of intelligence, commitment,
